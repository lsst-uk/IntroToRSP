# About the sessions

---

Each session will consist of three hour-long lectures, separated by breaks. A small amount of time will be dedicated to giving a brief introduction to the the Vera C. Rubin project, the LSST, key RSP concepts and terminology, data rights, and getting involved in the project. The remainder of the time will be spent giving demonstrations of potential use cases. These will involve going through Python code – typically in the form of Jupyter Notebooks – which demonstrate possible use cases. The aims of the sessions are to:
* familiarise people with the RSP environment;
* introduce key concepts within the RSP;
* demonstrate how to find out what data is held within the RSP;
* demonstrate what can be done within the RSP.

Our hope is that people will leave the sessions with at least a _sense_ of how they could achieve X within the RSP (where X is some kind of data retrieval or analysis related to their scientific area of interest).

Topics that will be covered include:
* how to determine what _types_ of data (exposures, coadds, detection tables, etc) are held within the RSP;
* how to determine what data of a given type is present in the RSP (i.e., a coadd covering a given patch of sky);
* what the Table Access Protocol and Data Butler are, and how to use them;
* how to retrieve table data and pixel-level (i.e., image) data;
* retrieving static and time-series data;

but if there are other topics that you think would be particularly useful for you or your group, then we are open to suggestions; just drop James an email at j.mullaney@sheffield.ac.uk .

Finally, as well as being information delivery sessions, it is also hoped that once people have been introduced to the RSP, then these sessions will also provide a means for the UK community to feed back what they hope to get from the RSP.
