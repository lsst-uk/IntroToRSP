# Data Access

---

**This page is for information only. You do NOT need LSST data access rights to attend the tutorials**

In return for the UK's in-kind contributions to the Vera C. Rubin project, UK-based astronomers can request proprietary access to LSST data. This includes access to the Data Preview 0 datasets that are used during the *Introduction to the RSP* tutorials.

The UK's in-kind package is valued at earning data rights for 300 PI's (PI = Faculty staff or senior fellow) and 1200 Junior Associates (JA = PhD students, postdocs) which is deemed to be sufficient to meet expected demand.

Since the number of UK-based PIs and JAs is limited, people who wish to hold data access rights need to apply to be awarded those rights. There is a call for applications roughly every six months, with the announcement of the calls made via the **lusc-announce** mailing list.

Instructions for how to join the lusc-announce mailing list are provided [here](https://lsst-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/24313864/LSST+UK+Announcements+Email+List).
