# Data Access

---

**This page is for information only. You do NOT need LSST data access rights to attend the tutorials**

In return for the UK's in-kind contributions to the Vera C. Rubin project, UK-based astronomers can request proprietary access to LSST data. This includes access to the Data Preview 0 datasets that are used during the *Introduction to the RSP* tutorials.

The UK's in-kind package is valued at earning data rights for 300 PI's (PI = Faculty staff or senior fellow) and 1200 Junior Associates (JA = PhD students, postdocs) which is deemed to be sufficient to meet expected demand.

Since the number of UK-based PIs and JAs is limited, UK-based people will, in the future, need to be members of the LSST:UK consortium to be eligible to gain those rights (at present, anyone can apply for access rights to Data Preview 0, but it is *a lot* easier for members of LSST:UK). People wishing to become members of LSST:UK need to apply during one of the calls for applictions. A call for applications is made roughly every six months, with the announcement of the calls made via the **lusc-announce** mailing list.

Instructions for how to join the lusc-announce mailing list are provided [here](https://lsst-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HOME/pages/24313864/LSST+UK+Announcements+Email+List).

Once someone has data access rights they need to get an account on the Rubin Science Platform. Instructions on how to do that are provided via [this link](https://rsp.lsst.io/guides/getting-started/get-an-account.html).
