# Tour Dates and Locations

---

In response to a request for expressions of interest, a number of institutes around the UK have been identified as being well located to host a session. There is roughly one location per region, and attempts have been made to select institutes in such a way that minimises total travel time for all of those that have expressed an interest.

It is expected that most people who have expressed an interest will be within roughly one hour’s train journey from at least one session. The chosen locations are outlined in the table below, which is ordered according to session date:

| Location | Date | Time | Serving |
|:---------|------|------|---------|
|U. of Nottingham|17 Jan 2024|11am-4pm|Nottingham, Birmingham, Leicester, Warwick, Keele|

|U. of Portsmouth|24 Jan 2024|1pm-5pm|Portsmouth, Southampton, Sussex|
|U. of Surrey|25 Jan 2024|1pm-5pm|London universities, Sussex|
|U. of Cambridge|TBC| |Cambridge|
|U. of Bath|21 Feb 2024|1pm-5pm|Bristol, Bath, Cardiff, Exeter|

Booked room sizes are based on the numbers of people that expressed an interest at each institute, and our expectation that most people will attend their nearest session (see the “Serving” column), but small numbers may attend other sessions. If the latter is the case for you, please email James at j.mullaney@sheffield.ac.uk to make sure there will be space at your preferred session.

There will also be an online session held _after_ all the in-person sessions have taken place. In-person attendance is, however, strongly preferred in order to aide discussion and to feed back what more the UK community wishes from the RSP.
