# Tour Dates and Locations

---

In response to a request for expressions of interest, a number of institutes around the UK have been identified as being well located to host a session. There is roughly one location per region, and attempts have been made to select institutes in such a way that minimises total travel time for all of those that have expressed an interest.

It is expected that most people who have expressed an interest will be within roughly one hourâ€™s train journey from at least one session. The chosen locations are outlined in the table below, which is ordered according to session date:

| Location | Date | Time | Serving |
|:---------|------|------|---------|
|U. of Nottingham|17 Jan 2024|11am-4pm|Nottingham, Birmingham, Leicester, Warwick, Keele|
