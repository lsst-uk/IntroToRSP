# Introduction to the Rubin Science Platform

Many of the astrophysical insights that the LSST will provide will stem directly from the sheer volume of data delivered by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. In many cases it will be impractical, if not impossible, to download and locally process the large amounts of data that will deliver the most groundbreaking research. With this in mind, the Rubin project will instead employ a “bring-your-code-to-the-data” model, whereby most data remains and is analysed within the Data Access Centres via the Rubin Science Platform (RSP).

Since most LSST data analysis will not be performed locally on one’s own filesystem and data formats, users will first need to become familiar with the RSP. While the learning curve is not especially steep, there are a number of concepts that are likely to be unfamiliar to many researchers when they start accessing LSST data products. With this in mind, James Mullaney from the University of Sheffield is running a number of sessions for UK-based astronomers which will introduce the Rubin Science Platform and demonstrate some of its features.
